Ports logic:

---> the last number of the port is related to the last number of the CLIENT's IP

1) LM as server
3000 - 3009: encrypted testament from LM to inheritor

3010 - 3019: shamir keys from LM to testamentors

3X00 - 3X10: sencrypted asset pieces from LM to testamentors

X represents the iteration of the pieces redundancy X>2 !!!! ex 3301, 3401 for node 1



2) Testamentors as servers

3200 - 3209: shamir keys from testamentors to inheritor

32Y0 - 32Y9: encrypted asset pieces from testamentors to inheritor

Y represents the iteration of the pieces redundancy Y>1 !!!! ex 3211, 3221 for node 1
